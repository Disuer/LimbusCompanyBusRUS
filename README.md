# Installation
### 1. Download and install [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.413-windows-x64-installer)
### 2. Install the framework mod
   - Download [BepInEx](https://github.com/LocalizeLimbusCompany/BepInEx_For_LLC/releases/tag/v6.0.1-LLC);
   - Drag the contents of the archive to the game folder
### 3. Let the framework load the files for the plugins to work and wait for the main screen to load and only then close the game
### 4. Prepare the game folder
   - On this step everything should work..
   - ![This is how should look your game folder](/src/firstscreen.png?raw=true)
### 5. Install my mod
   - Download [dll](../../releases), then drag it to ../Limbus Company/BIE/plugins/..

   - LAUNCH, MANAGER ESQUIRE!!!!!
   - (after first launch, it downloads my json file from this repo to properly work. if you hesitate about safety - download any dll ripper or reader and observe each line of my code.. or just look at my folder /src for mods)

### THIS MOD IS ONLY CLIENT-SIDE (means that all modifications from this dll will be visible only to you)
## Nicknames:
